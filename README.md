## filtrite
filtrite is a project for generating filter lists for [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/).
See the page about [Custom Ad Block Filters](https://www.bromite.org/custom-filters) for more info.

# Lists
You can choose any list from below, copy the link and add it in Bromite by going to settings > AdBlock settings, then setting Filters URL to the one you just copied.

Here's a list:


| Link | Description  |
| ------ | ------|
| [Bromite Default](https://github.com/xarantolus/filtrite/releases/latest/download/bromite-default.dat) | Bromite [default filter list](https://github.com/bromite/filters), but generated by this tool |
| [Bromite Extended](https://github.com/xarantolus/filtrite/releases/latest/download/bromite-extended.dat) | The default list with additional annoyance blockers I use with [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) on Desktop |
| [Bromite Extended](https://github.com/faridbagusid/filtrite/releases/latest/download/xnoncorp.dat) |  |


These lists are regularly updated automatically using GitHub Actions.

**Note**: I'm not 100% sure if all list formats that are used are actually supported by [the ruleset generation tool](https://github.com/xarantolus/subresource_filter_tools) (as the output indicates some failures). If you have a comment on that, please open an issue :)

### Contributing
This program is designed in a way that allows easily adding new lists. 
If you have an idea for new lists & combinations, then feel free to open an issue or pull request to point it out.

To add a new list:

1. Choose a name, e.g. `example-list`
2. Create a file `lists/example-list.txt` that contains all URLs. It should look like this:
```
# Comments and empty lines are allowed
# List one URL per line:
https://...
https://...

# This won't work, only put either a comment or an URL in one line, not both
http://  # Comment on URL
```
3. Save your file
4. Update [`generate.sh`](generate.sh) to include your entry:
```bash
...
# All other lists can be listed here

filtrite example-list

...
```
6. Link your filter list in the README, using this URL: `https://github.com/xarantolus/filtrite/releases/latest/download/{YOUR FILENAME}.dat`. Replace `{YOUR FILENAME}` with the filename of the `.dat` file.
7. Create a pull request


You can of course also fork this repository, create your own list and keep it on your own account. 
Enable GitHub Actions in the settings of your repository to make it work.
